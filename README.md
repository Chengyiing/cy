# Chengyi Cai

**Prospective PhD student in Energy Systems & Data Science**  
Carnegie Mellon University (PPM-DA)

I work at the intersection of **energy systems, optimization, and data-driven decision-making**,  
with a focus on **low-carbon electricity systems and data-center energy demand**.

## About me

I am a master's student at **Carnegie Mellon University**, enrolled in the **Public Policy and Data Analytics (PPM-DA)** program.

My academic background combines **systems thinking**, **quantitative modeling**, and **data analysis**, and I am particularly interested in applying optimization and machine learning methods to energy and climate problems.

I am currently preparing applications for PhD programs in **energy systems, operations research, and climate-focused data science**.


In my free time, I enjoy exploring Pittsburgh's diverse food scene and taking walks in nearby parks! I also like travelling and photograph, and this is my video website: [Cheng's Notes](https://space.bilibili.com/14696857?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0)
