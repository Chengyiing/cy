# Chengyi Cai

**Prospective PhD student in Energy Systems & Data Science**  
Carnegie Mellon University (PPM-DA)

I work at the intersection of **energy systems, optimization, and data-driven decision-making**,  
with a focus on **low-carbon electricity systems and data-center energy demand**.

# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me

I am a master's student at **Carnegie Mellon University**, enrolled in the **Public Policy and Data Analytics (PPM-DA)** program.

My academic background combines **systems thinking**, **quantitative modeling**, and **data analysis**, and I am particularly interested in applying optimization and machine learning methods to energy and climate problems.

I am currently preparing applications for PhD programs in **energy systems, operations research, and climate-focused data science**.


In my free time, I enjoy exploring Pittsburgh's diverse food scene and taking walks in nearby parks! I also like travelling and photograph, and this is my video website: [Cheng's Notes](https://space.bilibili.com/14696857?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0)

# Research Interests

My research interests include:

- **Low-carbon electricity systems** and capacity expansion modeling  
- **Data-center energy demand**, workload shifting, and grid interaction  
- **Optimization under uncertainty** for climate and energy systems  
- **Data-driven decision tools** for energy policy and infrastructure planning


## Methods & Skills

- Optimization (linear, mixed-integer)
- Python (data analysis, visualization)
- Machine learning for energy applications
- Data visualization and storytelling
